# RF and FFT on Studying re-opened bugs in open source software
Bug fixing accounts for a large amount of the software maintenance resources. Generally, bugs are reported, fixed, verified and closed. However, in some cases bugs have to be re-opened. Re-opened bugs increase maintenance costs, degrade the overall user-perceived quality of the software and lead to unnecessary rework by busy practitioners. The existing paper is a study on the prediction of re-opened bugs through a case study on three large open source project-Eclipse.
We will discuss and compare three machine learning algorithms - FFT, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
